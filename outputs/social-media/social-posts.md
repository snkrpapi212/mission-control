### Post 1 - Founder Announcement
**Character Count:** 298

I'm excited to announce the public launch of TaskFlow AI after 18 months of development.

Here's the problem we solved:

We spend 23% of our workweek just managing our work—switching apps, creating tasks, organizing schedules.

TaskFlow AI changes that. Our AI doesn't just assist—it understands context, anticipates needs, and automates the mundane.

Built for teams who want to focus on impact, not administration.

### Post 5 - Feature Deep Dive
**Character Count:** 312

Let me explain how TaskFlow AI's Smart Context works 🧵

Most AI tools respond to prompts. TaskFlow AI understands your work.

1/ Context Awareness
TaskFlow learns your project structures, deadlines, and working patterns over time.

2/ Proactive Suggestions
It doesn't wait for commands. It sees you're about to miss a deadline and offers help.

3/ Seamless Integration
Connects with your existing tools so you never lose data or workflow.
